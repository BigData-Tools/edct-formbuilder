Welcome to the eDCT Form Builder Project!
=========================================

eDCT Form Builder allows users to design data collection instruments utilizing a “drag-and-drop” interface.  
It provides a full range of options required for developing a complex and interdependent set of objects representing 
a complete model for collecting data.  It is used by [eDCT Collector](https://github.com/NCIP/edct-collector).

It is developed in Java and requires Apache Ant for building.
